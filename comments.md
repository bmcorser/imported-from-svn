I choose this simple project because I'm still working full time during the week and have other 'homework' from other companies to complete this weekend.

## Tasks

1. move all css/js to single files given the small size of each to reduce number of requests and increase readability
2. reorder files content without breaking the execution path for better readability
3. separate markup style and scripting
4. disable de annoying blink, it's bad UX and burns my eyes x|, also focussing on the adding functionality
5. added descriptive classes to each UI element
6. link to UI on window load
7. setup events on window load
8. class H5Calc that represents the model
9. handle errors in xhr request

## Tools
Atom.io
Safari + Web Inspector
