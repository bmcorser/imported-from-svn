Hi I'm Davide!
I choose this simple project because I'm still working full time during the week and have other 'homework' from other companies to complete this weekend.

## Tasks

1. move all css/js to single files given the small size of each to reduce number of requests and increase readability
2. reorder files content without breaking the execution path for better readability
3. separate markup style and scripting

## Tools
Atom.io
Safari + Web Inspector
