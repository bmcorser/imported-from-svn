Hi I'm Davide!
I choose this simple project because I'm still working full time during the week and have other 'homework' from other companies to complete this weekend.

## Tasks
1. move all css/js to single files given the small size of each to reduce number of requests and increase readability
2. reorder files content without breaking the execution path for better readability
3. separate markup style and scripting
4. disable de annoying blink, it's bad UX and burns my eyes x|, also focussing on the adding functionality
5. added descriptive classes to each UI element
6. link to UI on window load
7. setup events on window load
8. class H5Calc that represents the model
9. handle errors in xhr request

## Next steps
10. init npm module
11. create gruntfile
12. setup tasks clean, copy, lessc and jshint
13. setup tasks to minify html(htmlmin), css(cssmin), js(uglifyjs)
14. init bower package
15. bower install [yosegi](https://github.com/davidegaspar/yosegi), a less mixins library built by me to speed up UI styling
16. bower install fontawesome, an icon font I use regularly

## AngularJS
Other option would be to use angular as the project fits the MVC model

## Tools used
Atom.io
Safari + Web Inspector

## Final note
I am most comfortable with vanilla js, but understand that frameworks like Angular speed up the build process quite a lot, and I would like to have the opportunity to use it.
Unfortunately I have a history of 'not so great teams', so I've been using git alone and my workflow is entirely my creation, its all probably a bit messy and incomplete from the perspective of established teams. I look forward to join a team where I can improve my skills using these tools and learn how to properly run tests.
