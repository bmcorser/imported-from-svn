Hi I'm Davide!
I choose this simple project because I'm still working full time during the week and have other 'homework' from other companies to complete this weekend.

## Tasks

1. move all css/js to single files given the small size of each to reduce number of requests and increase readability
2. reorder files content without breaking the execution path for better readability

## Tools
Atom.io
Safari + Web Inspector
