# “Imported from SVN” homework task

> A commit lands in your terminal. It bears the dreaded subject _Imported from
SVN_.

This repository contains that commit. Someone mucked up the export from SVN and
lost the project’s commit history. You can just make out through the haze of
cruft ... a [janky](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=janky) old
web application written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Unfortunately the code has
suffered dreadful blight.

Oh no!

We don’t know why this is, perhaps no one loved the code. That doesn’t matter
now, let’s look at what we have in front of us. It’s not pretty:

 - No documentation!
 - No unit tests!
 - No modules!
 - No objects!
 - No build process!

Let’s fix that.


## Specification

This repository contains a web application that (whilst it appears to function
correctly) intentionally has a number of bugs, bad practices and common
mistakes. **THIS CODE IS INTENDED TO SEND YOUR WTFS/MIN THROUGH THE ROOF**

This homework is to find the bugs, bad practices and common mistakes and apply
the good and sensible practices alluded to in the introduction (along with any
that aren’t mentioned but may be applicable) to the small codebase here. Steps
undertaken should be documented and justified.

Probably the easiest way to document and justify the steps taken is by
carefully authoring your Git history: when you fix something, make a commit
that explains what you did and why. Don’t worry, we’ll read the whole history.

Please try to address one issue at a time (there are many, we know!) and make
a commit that contains only changes that address a specific bad practice. You
don’t have to do this, but it will make it easier for us to see your thinking.

If there are any things that were really bugging you, but you didn’t have time
to get to, write them down!
